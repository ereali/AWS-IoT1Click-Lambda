# AWS IoT 1Click Door Control Project
## DEPRECATED PROJECT - NO LONGER SUPPORTED
This is a project that was put together to initiate door override commands in a physical package over WiFi and not be reliant on a Mobile App. Using a suite of RESTful APIs that controlled physical doors in an access control system. This was designed to send API calls to an Azure function API gateway for further processing. 

Built-in Python 3.7. The Amazon IoT one-click button sends a specific button press event command which is parsed from the function and then passed into the outgoing REST call.
