# Introduction 
This was a project put together to initiate door override REST api calls (which controlled physical doors in an access control system). And then send the commands to an Azure function API gateway for further processesing. Built in Python 3.7. The Amazon IoT one click button sends an event command which is interpretted from the function and then passed into the outgoing REST call.
